## Deadline 23:59 24.04.2024

Pick any two tasks below. You can do three or four of them for extra credit. 

* (3 points) Impelement a parser for $\lambda$-terms.
   * Parser should parse the concrete syntax discussed in L09.
   * You can use any libraries in this task.
* (3 points) Impelement a pretty-printer for $\lambda$-terms.
   * Pretty-printer should not print unnecessary parentheses.
   * You can use any libraries in this task.
* (3 points) Implement normal-order reduction strategy.
   * This task can be done with either capture-avoiding substitution over $\lambda$-terms with normal variables in abstractions, or you can use De Bruijn indices (Google it). 
* (3 points) Implement applicative-order reduction strategy.
   * This task can be done with either capture-avoiding substitution over $\lambda$-terms with normal variables in abstractions, or you can use De Bruijn indices (Google it).

All these tasks should be accompanied with tests and a `main` function that demonstrates how it works.
